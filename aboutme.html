    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Venus is an innocent, little teenage girl that lives in Castro Valley and goes to Castro Valley High School. She's made lots of memorable friends as she transferred from school to school and joined new programs such as Girls Who Code. She is constantly curious about random stuff that probably everyone already knew and has a brain of a goldfish. Please don't be frustrated by her obvious questions and just try to play along!~</p>
