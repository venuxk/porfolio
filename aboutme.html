    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Venus is an innocent, little teenage girl that lives in Castro Valley and goes to Castro Valley High School. She's made lots of memorable friends as she transferred from school to school and joined new programs such as Girls Who Code. She is constantly curious about random stuff that probably everyone already knew and has a brain of a goldfish. Please don't be frustrated by her obvious questions and just try to play along!~</p>

   <h2>Reflection (Day 6.5)</h2>
   <p>Python and Scratch both have similar loop and pen features, but Python is a bit more complex because it's not as visual and colorful as Scratch. Also, the abbreviations in the Python language is harder to remember. ANNDDD Python is quite picky. Even very small things like colon and putting certain parts of the code before another part can change the way Python works, which was hard. But if I practice a bit more, I'll probably get the hang of it.</p>
   <p>Debugging is very challenging, but once you figure it out it's quite rewarding. I remember my mistakes better, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't make those same mistakes again.</p>

     <h2>Reflection (Day 11)</h2>
     <p>Both Manuela Veloso's work and Ayanna Howard's work included human interactions with their robots. They both helped people in some way to lessen their load of work in their daily lives.<p>
     <p>It's funny because my team gathered up all on one side of the table even though we had the whole other half of the table to ourselves. I thought we worked pretty well together as a small group. Half of the members did the coding, and the other half connected the wires and added on more lights to make the light show work. Our teamwork would have improved if the table was smaller and if we faced each other to talk.</p>
     <p>The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch includes: variables, functions, pinMode(), digitalWrite(), delay(), setup(), and loop().</p>

   <h2>Reflection (Day 12)</h2>
   <p>I learned that the positive side of the piezo has the be near the pins, and the other side has to have a wire connected to ground.</p>
   <p>My favorite part of my robot's dance was when it swirled around and the played music a the same time because it was difficult to make that happen. It just magically happened for a few seconds.</p>
   <p>Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need movement and sound outputs for their robots.</p>

    <p>I learned that spelling is suuuuppppeeerrrr important in C++ coding. We put in "rightWhiskerStare" instead of "rightWhiskerState" for one of our lines, and it made our Arduino robot stop working for about 2 hours. After Ankita pointed out our spelling mistake, it worked well. Our team worked worked well together and was patient enough to sit in front of our code going through everything in our code and checking our hardware. It was quite a thrilling ride!</p>

    <p>A list in Python is a group of integers or strings, and indiviual elements can be stored, added, or taken out from the list. Lists can be helpful for storing values for later use.</p>
    <p>I can't choose between Anna, Megan, Neha, and Kayley since they're all very easy and fun to work with. Yesterday, Megan and Anna helped me a lot with understanding the basics of the starter code for the Obamicon project. Today, Kayley and Neha helped me with the bugs in my code and had some fun with TRYING to add functions and other colors to the project. Both groups helped me out a lot in different ways! I'm glad I got to work with both!</p>

    <p>I learned that the mysterious "Cloud" is the place where all the database is stored with several servers.</p>
    <p>I think LaTeX is a programming language because it changes the style of documents, which is similar to Javascript.</p>

    <h2>Reflection (Day 16 - 7/19/17)</h2>
    <p>I understand pretty well about the cloning part in the Django framework where the code from Django to GitHub, but other than that I'm still a bit confused about everything that I copied and pasted.</p>
    <p>I would LOVE to learn about making your own dynamic graphics and putting it in my portfolio/Django blog.</p>

    <h2>Reflection (Day 19 - 7/24/17)</h2>
    <p>Even if you just put your birth date, gender, and zip code, a lot of information about you could be found on the internet because almost everyone's information is unique to themselves. Also, if healthcare or insurance companies accidentally leak some of your information on the internet, a lot can be found about you because data can spread everywhere online.</p>
    <p>A programmer can protect the privacy of his or her users by requiring them to set passwords that aren't words and by using encryption to make it harder for black hat hackers to steal their information.</p>
    <p>Latanya Sweeney protects people's privacy by alerting people that even just their birthday, gender, and zip code can give away all their information. Shafi Goldwasser does the same by working with others to create modern cryptography to provide secure electronic data transmission and exchange.</p>

    <h2>Final Projects</h2>
    <p>I enjoyed the most working on making our own websites and making the Arduino robot sing and dance.</p>
    <p>I would like to extend on making our websites more interactive and pretty. ^.^</p>
    <p>I would like to learn more about making our own phone app.</p>

     <h2>Reflection (Day 21 - 7/26/17)</h2>
     <p>Python dictionaries are useful for searching a specific item in your dictionary.</p>
     <p>I think I would be more interested in subjects having the intersection of math and computer science (data science) since I like the challenges in math and see myself having a career involving math in the future.</p>
     <p>I confused algorithims with operations before we started learning about them, so I'm glad I got it all sorted out by the end of today. I'm surprised that there are many different algorithms, or ways, that can be used to solve problems in computer science because computer language seems very strict in their coding.</p>
     <p>I'm sure algorithms are used to fix everyday technology that I don't know much about. Since there's many algorithms, each one can probably impact something, like fixing a bug.</p>

    <h2>Reflection (Day 22 - 7/27/17)</h2>
    <p>I think objects made this social networking project harder. First of all, the vocabulary made it very hard for me to process everything. I had to constantly look back at the slideshow with all the vocab to make things more understandable. Even doing that was kinda hard since the definitions were slightly hard to understand.</p>
    <p>I was proud that I finally got my indentation error fixed. Joyce and I spent about 15 minutes trying to add more indentations and take away some indentations, but it wasn't until Joyce who suggested to make a new file and paste the starter code in again that solved the problem. I'm not sure how we solved it, but when there's indentation errors, I'll just create a new file again.</p>

    <h2>Reflection (Day 23 - 7/28/17)</h2>
    <p>I didn't really figure out anything, but I'm glad Jillian taught me how to connect the Network class (blueprint) to the the main code so that a list of users could be shown.</p>
    <p>I'm most excited to see our graphics for my final project because I know we're gonna make it real cute!</p>

      <h2>Reflection (Day 24 - 7/31/17)</h2>
      <p>Being able to compromise is a skill that could help me be a more effective leader. I find it hard to include everyone's ideas, so I'm working on that.</p>
      <p>Since we are currently individually working on our game's main character's background story, I can try to incorporate everyone's cool ideas into one good background story.</p>
      <p>I can ask my teammates if I forgot any of their ideas that they really want to include to check on my improvement.</p>

  <div style="background-color:cornflowerblue;color:saddlebrown;padding:20px">
    <h2>Reflection (Day 25 - 8/1/17)</h2>
    <p>We're all working together for the script and backstory of our game. For today, Megan was the leader, Joyce was the note-taker, and I was the time-keeper. Megan is in charge of all the graphics of our game, and Joyce and I are in charge of making sure the user is able to click and interact with the game.</p>
    <p>I'm in charge of making sure the team is done with our tasks on time for the day, giving ideas for the script, and coding so that the player can interact in the game later on.</p>

    <div style="background-color:darkturquoise;color:saddlebrown;padding:15px">
      <h2>Reflection (Day 26 - 8/2/17)</h2>
      <p>The greatest challenge we faced so far was making three different storylines for our game because the choices that the player chooses throughout the game will change their story.</p>
      <p>We could assign storyline parts for each person since we always have a good, bad, and neutral choices that the player can choose from. Then, we can edit and read over each other's scripts to make the storylines better.</p>
  </div>
  
    <div style="background-color:cornflowerblue;color:saddlebrown;padding:20px">
      <h2>Reflection (Day 27 - 8/3/17)</h2>
      <p>We got pretty far into the game script and only need to make the different endings of the game!</p>
      <p>If only we could find a platform that is simple enough for everyone to see and edit each other's code at the same time on our separate laptops, then it would motivate and encourage us to keep on quickly working.</p>
      <p>A bug that we haven't been able to fix is the game ending. We're not sure how to fix our edge cases for the scoring of the player based on the choices they make, but we'll probably research and fix the problem by tomorrow. We just need more time.</p>
  </div>
  
      <div style="background-color:darkturquoise;color:saddlebrown;padding:15px">
        <h2>Reflection (Day 28 - 8/4/17)</h2>
        <p>I remember posting on Loop about being content, happy, and motivated, and I think I'm doing pretty good with my goal. My final project group with Megan and Joyce bonds pretty well, and it was really fun working with them!</p>
        <p>When Python syntax is confusing for our game, we just goof off. So a way to stay on task may be to switch what we're working on with one another so we can take our minds off of the struggles we're having and do something new. Your teammates might help you with your problem as they work on your part! I had stuggles trying to find a pretty dialogue box for our game, and Joyce and I switched roles and I looked for sound effects instead. It was a good break from my struggles.</p>
        <p>I don't really think of goals, but I'll put it in my reflections if I think of one. :D</p>

      <div style="background-color:cornflowerblue;color:saddlebrown;padding:20px">
        <h2>Relfection (Day 29 - 8/7/17)</h2>
        <p>Our text adventure game (with graphics) indirectly tells people to be morally good and to stand up for their decisions. In the game, the main character of our game shouldn't be pressured to help Damion kill the CEO of the software company just because they're friends.</p>
        <p>Our project might make people slightly violent??? Since there's shooting involved, it might influence players to think about shooting less importantly. To minimize this problem, we tried to make a bad ending for players who mostly chose negative choices to make them understand the bad consequences of taking a person's life. I'm not sure if that's a true problem for the users, but...I tried.</p>
