    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Venus is an innocent, little teenage girl that lives in Castro Valley and goes to Castro Valley High School. She's made lots of memorable friends as she transferred from school to school and joined new programs such as Girls Who Code. She is constantly curious about random stuff that probably everyone already knew and has a brain of a goldfish. Please don't be frustrated by her obvious questions and just try to play along!~</p>

   <h2>Reflection (Day 6.5)</h2>
   <p>Python and Scratch both have similar loop and pen features, but Python is a bit more complex because it's not as visual and colorful as Scratch. Also, the abbreviations in the Python language is harder to remember. ANNDDD Python is quite picky. Even very small things like colon and putting certain parts of the code before another part can change the way Python works, which was hard. But if I practice a bit more, I'll probably get the hang of it.</p>
   <p>Debugging is very challenging, but once you figure it out it's quite rewarding. I remember my mistakes better, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't make those same mistakes again.</p>

   <p>We learned a bit of C++ using the Arduino to make a LED light show today! The arrays were confusing at first, but after a few more tries we managed to make it work!</p>

     <h2>Reflection (Day 11)</h2>
     <p>Both Manuela Veloso's work and Ayanna Howard's work included human interactions with their robots. They both helped people in some way to lessen their load of work in their daily lives.<p>
     <p>It's funny because my team gathered up all on one side of the table even though we had the whole other half of the table to ourselves. I thought we worked pretty well together as a small group. Half of the members did the coding, and the other half connected the wires and added on more lights to make the light show work. Our teamwork would have improved if the table was smaller and if we faced each other to talk.</p>
     <p>The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch includes: variables, functions, pinMode(), digitalWrite(), delay(), setup(), and loop().</p>
